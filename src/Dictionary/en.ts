				description:
					"I'm a little pepper cat and the last entry in the Gatizole team. I was found on the road near Rome together with my little sister and after a long journey I arrived here. Despite my past, I love all human beings and I am very energetic. I tend to nibble on my hands, but maybe you can help me stop this habit by playing with me only with the games available!",
				likes: "jumping, running and playing, exploring what surrounds me",
				dislikes:
					"being moved without my consent, those who don't cuddle me.",

			Gianni: {
				description:
					"I am a pacioccone. My mother is human because when I was born I was so small that they had to breastfeed me with a bottle. I'm really a great tender and my stage name is Gianni Civetta. I am the brother of Alcide and therefore we often fight but for fun. Just a cuddle that I start the purr engine!",
				likes: "sleeping sprawled out, playing with anything, being cuddled",
				dislikes: "not received",

			Alcide: {
				description:
					"I am energetic and playful but also a great cuddle. I am a great explorer and I love to look at the world from above, even when I sleep I am always ready to play! My fur is soft and thick. Everyone here tells me that I will become a beautiful cat! ",
				likes: "exploring the most hidden places, playing and climbing",
				dislikes: "who forces me to do what I don't want!",

			Suzanne: {
				description:
					"I am a bit shy and shy, but just a scratch in the right place that I melt. I am a Munchkin and therefore I have short paws, but don't be fooled: I am agile and fast like any feline! I love tranquility and I want my spaces to be respected, but I am also a great playful... If you want to conquer me, just play with a ribbon or a thread!",
				likes: "playing with threads and balls, relaxing in my kennel",
				dislikes:
					"being teased for my height, those who do not respect my spaces",
